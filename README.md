# seq2seq_model_live

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElmBrKyMXxs&lc=z12gzlpggvy0ebk1b22oynvhsxv5sv4q104) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube as part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. We're going to build a sequence to sequence model, that is a bidirectional encoder and unidirectional decoder to reconstruct the input sequence. This will help us learn how memory and attention work. 

## Dependencies

* tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

## Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` in terminal and the code will pop up in your default browser. 

## Credits

Credits for the code go to [emitvay](https://github.com/ematvey/tensorflow-seq2seq-tutorials) i've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
